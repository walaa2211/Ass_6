# Ass_6
1) name the variables with meaningful names like (mm) to (month) ...etc.
2) I did not write comments to prove my point because this is a grave mistake, because the code should explain and clarify everything that its reader needs.
3) Function arguments not more than 3 .
4) if statement should not overlap.
5) margin number : that mean the code must not have multi number.
